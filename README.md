# Rimworld Dematerializer

![DeMaterializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterRimworlds/Dematerializer/trunk/Dematerializer/About/Preview.png)

The Dematerializer building allows you to teleport materials and pawns on the current map directly into the 
Dematerializer buffer, where the items and pawns will remain in suspended animation indefinitely, as long
as there is power in the subspace capacitors.

Every 1 kg stored in the buffer requires 2 kW of energy to maintain. On power loss, the least massive items
will be lost to subspace until power is restored.

When solar storms occur, the Dematerializer is fully powered by the solar wind.
