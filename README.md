# Rimworld Uplifted Animals

![ALZ-112](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterRimworlds/UpliftedAnimals/trunk/assets/ALZ-112.medium.jpg)

This mod adds a new drug, ALZ-112: A neurogenerative mRNA drug that either greatly increases intelligence and strength 
or kills any being exposed. It is usually 90% fatal in untested animals and humans.

For animals (and possibly humans) that it does succeed on, they are Uplifted to sentience (self-awareness) and massively
increased sentience and slightly increased speed and strength.

If they survive, any animal exposed to ALZ-112 will become a more integral part of your colony, complete with Backstory,
Full name, a Skill Set, and the ability to be trained to Attack and Haul, and if they are big enough, Rescue.

See the article [**Science or Science Fiction? Uplifting Animals**](https://www.yalescientific.org/2015/05/science-or-science-fiction-uplifting-animals/)
for more.

## Compatible Animals

As per the dictates of The High Evolutionary, HopeSeekr, ALZ-112 has been perfected for the following animals:

* Raccoons
* Thrumbos

For compatible animals, the chance of death is greatly diminished to just about 1 out of 81 odds.

Each animal will receive the following enhancements:

* Full name.
* Full backstory.
* Ability to Haul (if big enough).
* Ability to Rescue (if big enough).
* 150% Consciousness
* 115% Moving speed
* 150% Manipulation
* 125% Sight
* 125% Hearing
* 200% Metabolism (faster healing + immunity)
* High likelihood of Full Uplifting (e.g., become a non-Human Colonist in your colony).
* Lifespan is dramatically extended.

## Incompatible Animals

**[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!]**

For incompatible animals and Humans, the chance of death is randomly decided, anywhere from 100% instant death
to 6.5% (1 out of 15), with an average distribution of 40% Lethality.

Each animal will receive the following enhancements:

* 125% Consciousness.
* Ability to Haul (if big enough).
* Ability to Rescue (if big enough).
* Very, very slim chance of Full Uplifting (e.g., become a Colonist in your colony).

You can see the Lethality Odds of any exposed creature directly in the Health tab.

## Humans

**[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!]**

Humans are not likely to survive exposure, though it is possible. Any human that survives will have the following 
enhanced attributes:

1. Cured of Luciferium Addiction.
2. Cured of all brain ailments (Alzheimer's, Dementia, Trauma Savant, and cataracts).
3. 150% vision (stacks with bionics).
4. 150% hearing (stacks with bionics).
5. 300% consciousness (stacks with other attributes).
6. 150% global work speed.
7. Enhanced Immune System (equivalent of continual Penoxycyline).
8. Lifespan is dramatically extended to 250 years.
